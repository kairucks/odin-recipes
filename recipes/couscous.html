    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This couscous meal is wonderful. Me and my girlfriend eat it very often. Probably like 3-4 times a month. We're big fans.

            It is also easy and quick to make. Be prepared for the explosion of flavour.

                <li>Before starting, preheat the oven to 450Â°F. Wash and dry all produce. Core, then cut peppers into 1/2-inch pieces. Cut zucchini in half lengthwise, then into 1/2-inch thick half-moons. Zest, then juice half the lemon. (whole lemon for 4 ppl.) Cut any remaining lemon into wedges.</li>

                <li>Add peppers, tomatoes, zucchini and 1 tbsp oil (dbl for 4 ppl) to a baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper, then toss to combine. Roast in the middle of the oven, stirring halfway through, until tender, 14-15 min.</li>

                <li>Combine beef, 1/2 tsp lemon zest (dbl for 4 ppl), feta and breadcrumbs in a large bowl. Roll mixture into 8 equal-sized meatballs (dbl for 4 ppl). (TIP: If you prefer a firmer meatball, add an egg to the mixture!) Place meatballs on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake in the bottom of the oven until golden-brown and cooked through, 12-15 min.</li>
                
                <li>While meatballs cook, add 2/3 cup water, 1/8 tsp salt, 1 tbsp butter (dbl all for 4 ppl) and broth concentrate to a medium pot. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat.
